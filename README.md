CREATE A FORK OF THIS PROJECT TO KEEP YOUR WORK ON YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT

Steps for the project:

## Analyse the page

- Have a look at the full-design file
- Identify each element visible on the design.
  - Is it an img, a paragraph, a headline, etc? **Write on the side of the element the tyge of tag**
  - To fit the elements in a HTML page, how do you need to organise the div, the span? **Create an empty rectangle with border which for each div on the design** 
- Organise your work in block
  - How can you split the sections? Write down your strategy an include it as a note in the project

## Build the HTML page

- Now, you have a better idea of how the page is structured and which elements are used. Let's create the HTML page.
- [ ] Create new file called recipe-details-page.html
- [ ] Add default html structure
- [ ] Create a new file called style.css
- [ ] Link the html file with the css tg using the link tag
- [ ] Follow your plan and complete the project
- !IMPORTANT: Do not worry about responsive design for now. Make just the design is well displayed on your local. We can adjust later.
- Go step by step, one piece of the design at the time.
